abstract: "Anafi and Kimolos are members of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc (SAVA) and together with Folegandros belong to the phytogeographical region of the Cyclades (KIK). In the present study we investigate the flora of each of these three islands: Anafi hosts 635 taxa (181 new records), Kimolos 443 taxa (225 new records) and Folegandros 474 taxa (145 new records). Folegandros has the highest percentage of Greek endemics in the phytogeographical area of the Cyclades (8.55%), while Kimolos has the highest percentage of Greek endemics in the SAVA (6.88%), followed by Anafi (5.99%). Furthermore, the known distribution of the endemics Anthemis rigida subsp. liguliflora (Kimolos), Sedum eriocarpum subsp. eriocarpum (Kimolos), Sedum littoreum var. creticum (Anafi) and Sternbergia greuteriana (Anafi and Folegandros) is expanded, being reported for the first time for the phytogeographical region of the Cyclades. Moreover, the indigenous presence of Phoenix theophrasti in Anafi, and therefore in the phytogeographical region of the Cyclades, is confirmed, as several individuals were found to occupy similar ecological niches (in four different locations) as in the locus classicus. We also investigated the biotic and abiotic factors that affect plant species richness in the phytogeographical region of the Cyclades (KIK) and identified the plant diversity hotspots in the same region. Area and geodiversity explained a large proportion of variance for the native taxa found in KIK. Moreover, area, maximum elevation, mean annual precipitation and human population density explained a large proportion of variance for the Greek endemic taxa found in KIK. Maximum elevation was the only factor that explained a large proportion of variance for the Cycladian endemic taxa, while the shortest distance from the nearest mainland emerged as a significant explanatory variable, but with relatively weak predictive power, regarding the South Aegean endemic taxa found in KIK. Furthermore, Anafi, Amorgos and Folegandros were found to be endemic plant diversity hotspots in KIK, while Anafi was found to be the most important plant diversity hotspot in the South Aegean Sea, followed by the vast majority of the members of the SAVA, together with Serifos. We also investigated the phytogeographical relationships of the islands comprising the phytogeographical region of the Cyclades (KIK), by following a network analytical approach through applying a module-detecting algorithm. We identified biogeographical modules within KIK and we explained the causes that lie behind their formation. The phytogeographical region of the Cyclades is divided in five biogeographical modules, the borders of which correspond remarkably well to the palaeogeographical and climatic compartmentalization of the Cyclades, and show a striking similarity to the region’s palaeogeographical history since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The identified module borders may indicate the main borderline for which islands are sinks or stepping stones for migration and colonization from the phytogeographical regions encircling that of the Cyclades. The absence of several Peloponnese and East Aegean endemics from the Cyclades (“Kykladenfenster”) can be attributed to the fact that the Cyclades may have acted as an ecogeographical filter for the distribution of several plant lineages."

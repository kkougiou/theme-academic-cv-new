abstract: "Methana peninsula belongs to the South Aegean Volcanic Arc and is constituted mainly of volcanic rocks and only its southern part is calcareous. Methana's peninsular rich flora is comprised by 75 families, 316 genera and 621 taxa, 378 of which are new references, 38 endemics and 102 under protection status. For three taxa (Crocus sieberi subsp. atticus, Trigonella rechingeri και Brassica cretica subsp. aegea), by finding them on Methana peninsula, their distribution area is expanded. The therophytes and the Steno- and Eury-Mediterranean elements prevail. From the phytogeographic correlations with the islands of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, as well as with some Ionian and West Aegean islands, Methana peninsula is found to have the highest floristic affinities with the Western Kikladhes complex. 20 habitat types were recognised and it was found that the ecological succession on Methana peninsula follows the generalised model of the ecological succession on recently created volcanic areas."

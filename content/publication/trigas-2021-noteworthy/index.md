abstract: "This contribution to the Greek flora includes distribution extensions and taxonomic notes for some noteworthy plant taxa. New records for certain phytogeographical regions of Greece are presented for: *Arum cylindraceum*, *Convolvulus pentapetaloides*, *Cruciata taurica*, *Galanthus reginae-olgae* subsp. *vernalis*, *Ilex aquifolium*, *Linum decumbens*, *Lythrum thymifolia*, *Sedum praesidis*, *Silene congesta* and *Trifolium diffusum*, *Allium karistanum*, *Helichrysum amorginum*, *Limonium antipaxorum* and *L. cephalonicum* have been recorded for the first time on some islands. New populations of *Allium maniaticum* and *A. ritsii*, previously known only from their loci classici, were discovered in the Peloponnese. *Valeriana alliariifolia*, *Silene auriculata* subsp. *auriculata* and *Symphytum creticum* were rediscovered in central Evvia, confirming long-lost historical records from previous centuries. The presence of *V. alliariifolia* in Greece and Europe is confirmed for the first time since the 19th century."
